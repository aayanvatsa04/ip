 *
 * <p>The user's messages and Billy's are the same box built two ways round,
 * rather than two classes that would have to be kept in step with each other.
 *
 * <p>The two are shown differently on purpose. This is not a conversation
 * between two people: the user types short commands, and Billy answers with
 * whatever the command produced, which may be a list of thirty tasks. So the
 * user's words sit on the right in a bubble no wider than it needs to be, and
 * Billy's take the full width of the window on the left. Errors are Billy's
 * words in a third form again, since the whole point of an error is that it
 * should not be skimmed past.
